This is a game in Python by David, Bella, Raheem, Emmauel
This is a simple platformer game for one player. 
There will be three sections:

Part 1:

The opening screen will show the controls.

Ex:

- left arrow key is move left
- right arrow key is move right
- up arrow key is jump up
- three lives
(other planned features):
-x is attack
-c is ranged attack

Part 2:

The next screen is the first stage of the game. The screen will move down continuously. Leaving the screen will result in losing a life, and you must navigate to the top of a tower using platforms. Obstacles such as rocks, fireballs and enemies will impede you.
There may be collectibles needed to access the final stage, possibly in the form of a riddle.  We may also add multiple instances of this section.

Part 3: 

The final stage is a boss fight .

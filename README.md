This is a game in python
It made by... David, Bella, Raheem, Emmauel
This is a platform game and is played by one player 
three parts to the game:

Part 1:

the opening screen is the how to screen, it will show you how to play the game.
One of the things it will show is what Buttons there is, and what the buttons do
Ex:
- z is change weapon
- x is attack
- A is use arrow
- left arrow key is move left
- right arrow key is move right
- up arrow key is jump up
- three lives

Part 2:

The next screen is the start of the game the screen moves down continuasly, you cannot move down and if you dont move up you loose a life, we want this part of the game is either a tower going up or platforms leading up. You have to dodge fireballs/rocks and or fight little bad guys
- there might be a side bar that contains little clues that you need to put together to answer the question to get to the boss level, the question changes each time the game is restarted

Part 3: 

Once you reach the boss you come to a screen where the boss is on one side and you must defeat him to win the game. 
these are the 2 basic levels to the game but their can be more levels added and these can be changed.
